# OfficialPerScholasCaseStudy
This is my official PerScholas case study. Complete with branching, well thought out committing timeframes, and adequate documentation.

This project is for a web-app that contains a combination of HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Java, and absracted SQL(through the use of JPA & Hibernate). This web-app makes use of the Spring Boot framework, Bootstrap, DAOs, and more.

My goal for this project was to create a website that enabled a community garden to elegantly convey it's vision, mission, goals, and opportunities to anyone who happened to stumble upon their website intentionally or unintentionally.
